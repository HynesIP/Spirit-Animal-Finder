# Friend_Finder

Friend_Finder is a full stack website. Included in the applcation is aback back end: api database, routers, server.js, and front end: html, bootstrap/css, and app.js.

A Friend Finder application is designed to match a person to another person.  This specific application is design to match a person to their spirit animal. The user will enter their name and a link to their picture and are redirected to a 10 question survey.  The user's answers are recorded and compared against the answers of the spirit animals.  A match is made by using an algorithm that finds the sum of the differences between the user's answers and the answers of the spirit animal.  
 
Example 1 Single diffenece of answer:
 
User answer to question #1 : 5

Animal answer to question #1 : 1

The difference is 4.


Example 2 Sum of differences of answers:

User answers: 1,2,3,4,5

Animal answers: 5,4,3,2,1

Differences: 4,2,0,2,4

Sum of the differences:12

After I find the sum of the differences between the user and all the animals, I find the animal with the lowest sum of differences and that is the match.

The second part of the application is that the user information is saved and added to the database.  This is the basis for survey driven dating or friend finding applications.  For my application, you can then becaome someone elses spirit animal!!
